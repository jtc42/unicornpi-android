# unicornpi-android

Android app to access the [web API](https://github.com/jtc42/unicornpi-server) created for the [Pimoroni Unicorn HAT
](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat)

## Getting started
* Set up and run the server-side script found [here](https://github.com/jtc42/unicornpi-server).
* Open the app, go to Settings (in the main menu), and edit the IP address and port to match your Pi.
* The app should automatically update itself when you switch to a new tab from the bottom nav bar.

## Troubleshooting
* If the app hangs on a loading screen, double check the IP address + port you set is correct. Also ensure that the Flask server is running on your Pi without issue.
